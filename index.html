        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          In recent years, as the impact of the pandemic has begun to wane, there has been a surge in leisure 
          travel [1]. Unlike business travelers, many leisure travelers choose to fly an airline based on ticket prices, 
          often opting to fly Low-Cost Carriers (LCCs) [1] [2]. While economy class seats on-board an LCC are not comfortable 
          to begin with due to prioritizing maximizing seat count and minimizing costs, this discomfort becomes even more 
          apparent on long-haul flights, flights over six hours long, which the majority of leisure flyers are embarking on [3]. 
          As such, passengers are starting to choose airlines based on comfort along with price [4]. Since this comfort is readily 
          available on Full-Service Carriers (FSCs), it becomes easier to choose them over LCCs. Therefore, there is a need to 
          re-design economy class seats for LCCs to eliminate discomfort, especially on long-haul flights, to improve passenger 
          experience and introduce a new competitive factor for LCCs.

      <div id="background">
        <h3>2.1. Background</h3>
        <p>
          An LCC, contrary to popular belief, focuses on minimizing operating costs rather than offering low ticket prices; 
          it is the opposite to an FSC. For example, Singapore Airlines is an FSC while Scoot is an LCC. There are three main 
          ways through which an LCC minimizes operational costs:
          <br />
          <br />1) Using fewer aircraft models
          <br />2) Having single cabin configurations
          <br />3) Choosing to operate out of secondary airports
          <br /><br />
          Their ticket pricing mechanism, which will not be discussed in this report, revolves around offering minimum amenities 
          needed for transporting a person from point A to point B as a part of the ticket price while imposing additional charges 
          for incentives such as in-flight meals and check-in baggage. With lower operating costs, cost savings can be passed on to 
          the traveler, encouraging more passengers to travel [5].
        </p>

      <div id="single-aircraft-fleet">
        <h4>2.2.1. Single aircraft fleet</h4>
        <p>
          As mentioned above, one of the ways LCCs minimize operating costs is by operating fewer aircraft models as opposed to FSCs that operate many aircraft models. For example, American Airlines, an FSC, operates eight aircraft models while Southwest Airlines, an LCC, operates only one aircraft model [6]. By operating fewer aircraft models, LCCs need only train their employees to work on fewer models of aircraft, lowering training costs. Pilots within the same airline can be easily substituted for one another if necessary since many pilots within that airline would be trained to operate the same aircraft model, and the airline spends lesser money in maintenance because they only need to purchase parts for a few aircraft models [5].
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="single-cabin-configuration">
        <h4>2.2.2. Single cabin configuration</h4>
        <p>
          Most LCCs also only offer a single cabin configuration i.e. economy class, while FSCs offer multiple cabin configurations i.e. economy, premium economy, business, and first class. This allows for airlines to fit more seats in a single aircraft, which allows them to carry more passengers on a flight. The more passengers an aircraft can carry, the more people there are to share the cost of a flight which lowers ticket prices. On top of that, operating a single type of seat lowers maintenance costs [5].
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="choosing-secondary-airports">
        <h4>2.2.3. Choosing secondary airports</h4>
        <p>
          LCCs choose to fly in and out of secondary airports as opposed to primary airports. Primary airports are airports located closer to city centres and are rich with features, making them more popular with airlines and passengers and thus more expensive to operate out of. Secondary airports, on the other side, may often be further away from city centres, offer less facilities, like the lack of jetways or fancy boarding gates, but cost a lot cheaper to fly in and out of which works to the benefit of low-cost carriers [5]. For example, in New York City, John F. Kennedy International Airport is the primary airport while LaGuardia is a secondary airport. Consequently, an LCC flying in and out of New York will choose to operate out of LaGuardia.

      <div id="leasing-vs-owning-aircraft">
        <h3>2.3. Leasing vs Owning Aircraft</h3>
        <p>
          LCCs can be divided into two distinct groups: airlines that own their own aircraft and airlines that lease them from other airlines [7]. It is important to identify which airline falls under which category because while we are designing aircraft seats for passengers that fly LCCs, we are marketing this product to LCCs themselves. LCCs that own their own aircraft will be more willing to make changes to their aircraft fleet like purchasing and installing new aircraft seats as opposed to LCCs that lease their aircraft and thus must be the primary target for this product.

        <h3>2.4.1. Price and comfort as deciding factors for passengers</h3>
        <p>
          The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed air travel. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, business travel was a major contribution to airline profits. While business travelers only made up about 12% of all passengers, they accounted for up to 75% of the profits. However, after the pandemic, business travel has declined as most business meetings are conducted remotely over platforms like Zoom and Google Meet, and companies have changed their travel policies [2]. However, the demand for air travel is at an all-time high and that is because of leisure flying.

          A survey conducted by YouGov illustrates the factors passengers look for when booking a budget flight [9]. 
        </p>

        <div style="text-align: center;">

          <p><em>Figure 4: Survey results from YouGov</em></p>
        </div>

        <p>
          As shown in Figure 4, there are several factors passengers typically consider when booking a budget flight. The first five items on the list are out of control; we are unable to control things like baggage allowance and airline reputation; the first thing we can control is comfortable seating. While price is still the main factor behind why a passenger would choose to fly an airline, they are also starting to choose based on on-board comfort and facilities, and are willing to pay more for a comfortable flight [4]. Since this comfort is readily available on FSCs, it makes it easier to choose them instead of LCCs especially on long-haul flights.
<br>In fact, a choice experiment was conducted by a group of economists from the UK to study passengers’ willingness to pay. The study offered passengers with four different ticket options with varying prices and attributes as shown in Figure 5 and found out that, on average, passengers were willing to pay 33.25% more for a more comfortable flight [10].

      <div id="role-seat-eliminating-discomfort">
        <h3>2.4.2. The role of a seat in eliminating discomfort</h3>
        <p>
          There are many factors of an aircraft’s on-board experience that affect comfort and discomfort as shown in Figure 5. While factors like refreshment and relaxation are controlled by various elements like service and interior condition, only factors affected by the aircraft seat cause discomfort [11].
        </p>

          <p><em>Figure 6: Factors that affect comfort and discomfort onboard an aircraft</em></p>
        </div>

        <p>
          It is important to understand that just eliminating discomfort does not induce comfort. However, factors contributing to discomfort must be eliminated for comfort to be experienced. For example, if a passenger is experiencing fatigue, offering them a refreshing drink will not make them feel comfortable.
        </p>

      </div>
    
      <div id="value-proposition">
        <h3>2.5. Value Proposition</h3>
        <p>
          An aircraft seat designed to eliminate discomfort can be beneficial for both LCC passengers and LCCs. The value for passengers is that an aircraft seat designed to eliminate fatigue, pain, posture issues, stiffness, and heavy legs allows them to have an overall better experience flying with LCCs, especially on long-haul flights without having to pay more to fly on an FSC just for more comfort. 
<br>For LCCs on the other hand, having better aircraft seats allows them to increase passenger satisfaction and build brand loyalty which will increase profits in the long run. It also introduces a new competitive factor other than price that allows LCCs to stand out from competitors by positioning themselves as a budget-friendly airline that values passenger comfort.

        From a design perspective, there is a lot of freedom in conceptualizing aircraft seats. They can even take the shape of a bed as shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10 as long as they meet the safety requirements set for them as shown in Table 1.

    <div id="design-considerations">
      <h4>2.7.2. Design Considerations</h4>
      <p>
        When designing an aircraft seat, it must be ensured that the seat allows for a variation in posture: the passenger must be able to move and shift freely within the space of the seat. The seat must also be comfortable when engaged in various activities like sleeping and reading instead of being designed to be comfortable for specific activities only. 
<br><br>Furthermore, there is the presence of shear force on an aircraft seat. The effect of this force is the tendency to slide forward when the seat is reclined as illustrated in Figure . This force has a strong association with discomfort and must be addressed when designing an aircraft seat [11].
      </p>

        <p><em>Figure 11: Shear Force on an Aircraft Seat</em></p>
      </div>

      <p>
        A big challenge in evaluating the comfort of an aircraft seat is that currently there is no quantifiable way to measure comfort, therefore real human participants are needed to provide qualitative feedback on the comfort of the seat. Preferences of passengers, such as the activity they would like to engage in during a flight, must be considered when designing an aircraft seat [11]. 
      </p>
      
    </div>
  
    
    <div id="design-approach">
      <h4>2.7.3. Design approach</h4>
      <p>
        To design the aircraft seat, we first came up with ideas in the form of sketches. From the sketches, rapid prototyping was done using cardboard to filter out ideas based on feasibility and to extract principles that can be applied to other prototypes. Then the selected prototypes were evaluated based on a set of selection criteria, and two base concepts were identified for further prototyping. A higher fidelity prototype was made using craftboard to refine the design of the mechanisms before a final small-scale prototype was made to conduct an in-depth analysis of the geometry of the design and mechanisms and to gauge user reaction.

        <h2>3. Ideation</h2>
        <p>
          Rapid ideation focuses on generating many ideas in a short time. This is a stage for brainstorming to bring in a variety of perspectives and ideas between team members, and an open exchange of ideas may solve difficulties in ways individuals may not achieve [13]. Two prototyping tools were used to rapidly explore ideas on how to improve comfort in our aircraft seats.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sketches">
        <h3>3.1. Sketches</h3>
        <p>
          Sketches were used as a quick, exploratory tool for functionality and technical elements. This method of rapid ideation acts as a visual aid in communication when we introduce our ideas to each other. Sketches offer a balance of speed and creativity in exploring ideas and allows us to iterate without overcommitting in any direction [14]. As a filter, it also helped to identify concepts with potential where features can be further explored with physical prototypes.
<br> Some concepts were eliminated for the next stage in prototyping as these concepts would not benefit from the following method of prototyping. For example, there is a concept of using gel cushions on the aircraft seat to regulate temperature for passenger comfort and be more space efficient, but this feature is difficult to be represented in rapid cardboard prototyping. Hence, these concepts were not furthered in prototyping.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="rapid-cardboard-prototyping">
        <h3>3.2. Rapid Cardboard Prototyping</h3>
        <p>
          Rapid cardboard prototyping was an accessible way to test functionality and technical feasibility, revealing insights that are not seen in sketches. Prototyping principles were then extracted to organize the concepts before shortlisting them for further development.
<br>Cardboard prototypes of the selected sketches were created using the CriCut Cutting Machine, allowing us to make precise cuts in the cardboard that enables the prototype feature to be represented accurately. As interactive models, the ideas were then evaluated in terms of feasibility; they also aided in communication that guides future concept refinement.
<br>Based on the mechanism of each idea, analogies were used to name the principles. The structured framework aids in exploring potential design improvements, as these analogies can be applied across different parts of the seat to explore new concepts.

          Prototypes were then evaluated on a set of criteria based on their feasibility and potential to create comfort. Firstly, the space occupied by the prototype should allow for the seating configuration to remain unchanged in an aircraft. This means that the number of seats per aircraft should not decrease. Secondly, the prototypes are to be evaluated based on comfort and cost tradeoffs. In this, the aim will be to only develop concepts that provide significant comfort and align with LCCs in minimizing operational costs. This leads to the last criterion, where we avoid simply transferring seats from FSCs to LCCs. At this stage, there is no quantitative evaluation of comfort due to the low fidelity of the prototypes, but that is planned to be done in the later stages.

          Two base concepts were selected based on the criteria mentioned in the previous section.

        </div>

        <p>
          The first core concept allows the seat pan to tilt up at a fixed ratio as the passenger leans back, and a fixed backrest isolates the backrest tilt from the passenger behind, hence the name “Fixed Frontspace”. This concept aims to allow more comfort in existing seating configurations.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          The second core concept allows the backrest to rotate around the center of the chair, and thigh support can slide out from under the seat to support the legs. The purpose of this concept is to allow for more seating configurations, which may provide more comfort.

          There are also concept principles that are modular and can be integrated with either base concept. These concepts will be tested individually before an integrated prototype is derived so that the comfort value provided by each concept is significant.

          Each prototype stage was meaningfully performed and centered on its purpose to further the concept design. This stage of prototyping and testing focused on the development of the two core concepts in its feasibility.

      <div id="cad-models">
        <h3>4.1. CAD Models</h3>
        <p>
          Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models of both base concepts were created to analyze their geometry, forming the foundation for the next physical prototyping stage. As CAD allows a precise environment to test and refine technical aspects, revealing insights on geometry that were not apparent before, these models were used to craft the next physical prototypes.

        </div>

        <p>
          In another concept, kinematic chains were explored as a method for the seat’s synchronous mechanism. A kinematic chain is an assembly of rigid bodies connected by joints to provide constrained motion that is the mathematical model for a mechanical system [15]. It allows for synchronized movement where all parts move in sync smoothly, and the mechanical ratios in the chain maintain a balanced distribution of forces. Kinematic chains of different linkage sizes were tried, and this method was found to be suitable to actuate the synchronous mechanism.

        <h3>4.2. Refined Craftboard Prototypes</h3>
        <p>
          Craftboard, a sturdier and cleaner material than cardboard, was used to create prototypes of the core concepts based on the CAD models created earlier. This material created a higher degree of accuracy to represent our concepts and receive feedback that can help to refine mechanisms and validate the design choices made.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          The prototypes were a closer model of the mechanisms that enabled our intended design and allowed for a clearer sense of the product’s performance and usability. These prototypes were used to evaluate our final concepts.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="selected-core-concept">
        <h3>4.3. Selected Core Concept</h3>
        <p>
          Between the two core concepts, the synchronous mechanism emerged as the most advantageous. Its benefits have been documented extensively in academic and ergonomic research in enhancing comfort as it offers coordinated movement between the backrest and seatpan [16]. The fixed frontspace allows for each passenger’s activities to be isolated, allowing them to comfortably engage in their own activities. Lastly, the sliding thigh support offers the potential to elevate comfort by relieving the pressure on the passengers’ legs. The combination of these three design concepts has great potential in creating comfort for the passengers and will form the core concept moving forward.
        </p>

        <h3>4.4. Acrylic Prototypes</h3>
        <p>
          CAD models were refined to integrate the selected core concept, aiding in the building of the next prototype.
        </p>

        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <img src="assets/figure22.png" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto;">
          <p><em>Figure 22: Refined CAD models</em></p>
        </div>

        <p>
          The next prototype was created by laser cutting acrylic sheets. This layer of prototyping reveals potential errors during fabrication and explores ways of reducing them. Additionally, this also confirms a certain degree of functionality in the mechanism, as the sliding actuation in the synchronous mechanism was able to be manipulated smoothly. This prototype was a suitable fidelity to conduct user idea reaction, and how they interact with the product to uncover unknown requirements.
        </p>

        <div style="text-align: center;">

          <p><em>Figure 23: Acrylic Prototype</em></p>
        </div>

        <p>
          As a subsequent step, users who have experience flying LCCs were engaged to interact with the acrylic prototype. As they explored the concept, they drew analogies to existing chairs like the OSIM® Singapore massage chair and rocking chairs. This helped the users in visualizing and understanding the concept.
<br>The users were satisfied with the greater number of sitting configurations, and the existence of the thigh support that relieves pressure on the legs. However, they were concerned with some areas like leg space, seat size, headrest, sharing of armrests, and their suitability for passengers of varying heights. All of these factors are foreseen to be addressed by the modular concepts mentioned earlier, so this feedback should be compared with future testing of the modular features.

      <div id="user-testing-prototypes">
        <h3>4.5. User Testing Prototypes</h3>
        <p>
          We have performed extensive small-scale prototyping centered around the feasibility of the ideas has been conducted. User testing prototypes move on to assessing the comfort provided by the selected concepts. This prototyping stage aimed to observe user reaction to the concepts. This includes factors like the range of activities, legroom, and back support. The test sought to derive open-ended feedback, both qualitative and quantitative. This prototyping test was performed with 4 users.

        <div id="synchronous-mechanism">
          <h4>4.5.1. Synchronous Mechanism</h4>
          <p>
            The first half of the user test aimed to determine whether the users felt more comfortable in a synchronous mechanism chair or in a chair where only the backrest will tilt, imitating the existing aircraft seat. 
          </p>

          <div style="text-align: center;">

          </div>
          
          <p>
            We invited users to sit on both chairs and engage in activities they would do on a flight, then asked about their experience in both chairs after. The insights we gathered from the users were that the synchronous mechanism allows for a more natural inclination of the body and allows for activities to be done more comfortably longer. A noteworthy concern was about their feet not being able to touch the ground, which is generally seen as uncomfortable.

            The second half of the test aimed to determine how the users felt about the fixed frontspace concept compared to the existing aircraft seat. The fixed frontspace was demonstrated with a cardboard back that isolated the backrest tilt of the passenger in front from the user.

            The insights we gathered from the users were that the fixed frontspace allows for activities to be done without being interfered with by the seat in front, and it also creates an isolated space suitable for passengers of all ages, especially children.

            The feedback on this user test was influenced by the material differences in the chairs, resulting in the feedback given to be broad and unfocused on the feature being tested. In future rounds of user testing, prototypes must be refined to be more homogenous to minimize external factors, enabling clearer user feedback on the mechanisms.

          With this progress thus far, we aim to refine the prototypes to be more homogenous and build the modular concepts before assembling the concepts as an integrated prototype. Tests with the modular concepts should be done individually to enable user feedback that is focused on the modular feature itself, ensuring each feature provides significant comfort. With the integrated prototype, we aim to perform an overall user testing to evaluate its effectiveness in creating comfort for its passengers.
<br>With the modular feature integrated into our core concept, the following figure depicts what is intended for the prototype to have.

          In conclusion, this project aims to create a new standard with comfort by designing aircraft seats that meet both affordability and comfort. Extensive literature review has been performed to support the value proposition of the project, and various iterations of prototypes have been created to establish forward direction in developing the final concept design. Moving on, we aim to test full scale prototypes of the core concept and modular features before arriving at an integrated prototype, which will achieve the objectives of eliminating discomfort in passengers of LCCs, allowing them to experience comfort.
